## Visionary_AP_DigitalIO

Showing basic functionality for using the IO ports.

### Description

The bidirectional digital ports can be defined as input or output. The basics for using the ports are shown in this application. Setting a port to as input, setting a port as output and registering a function to a change in the input signal.

### How to run

Start by running the app (F5) or debugging (F7+F10).
Set a breakpoint on the first row inside the main function to debug step-by-step.

### Implementation

Some digital ports are input only, while others are bidirectional. The direction of a bidirectional digital port is set by using different create() methods.
